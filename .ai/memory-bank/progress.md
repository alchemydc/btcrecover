# Progress

## What Works
- Project brief and Memory Bank structure established.
- Security requirements and technical context documented.

## What's Left to Build
- Document proof-of-concept steps for 25th word (BIP39 passphrase) recovery using the CLI.
- Implement and test CLI recovery workflow.
- Design and build the GUI frontend.
- Integrate GUI with btcrecover backend.

## Current Status
- In planning and documentation phase.
- No functional CLI or GUI components yet; focus is on requirements, architecture, and security.

## Known Issues
- None at this stage; implementation not yet started.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Security elevated to a top-level requirement (handle seeds/passphrases with care).
- Use of Python virtual environments (venv) mandated for dependency isolation.
- Documentation-first workflow adopted to ensure clarity and continuity.
